## Streamed Movies & TV Shows Dataset

Over the past decade, streaming services have rapidly transformed the way people consume entertainment, rising to dominate the media landscape. As more people turn to digital platforms for personalized viewing experiences, streaming services continue to redefine modern entertainment consumption. Are you into streaming? What was the most recent movie or TV show you watched?

This workshop utilizes a comma-separated value (CSV) file which is derived from the movies and TV shows featured by major streaming services and distributed in Kaggle Project under a CC0 Public License[^1].

For this project, we have merged six `titles.csv` files—each representing one of the streaming services featured in this project (Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Netflix, and Paramount)—into a single master spreadsheet.

The dataset contains 25,223 rows with movies and TV series titles along with the following variables as described in the data dictionary:

-   streaming: streaming service/provider
-   id: unique movie or TV series ID
-   title: movie or TV series title
-   type: if movie or tv series
-   description: the synopsis/plot summary
-   release_year: YYYY
-   classification: age group movie age categories including G (General Audiences), PG (Parental Guidance), PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), R (Restricted), and NC-17 (No One 17 and Under Admitted).
-   runtime: total time in minutes
-   genre(s): the thematic classification that define the type of story, themes, and style of the production, by order of relevance.
-   country: code for country or countries responsible for the production, ordered by importance.
-   imdb_id: unique ID attributed to each production by IMDB.
-   imdb_score: the rating on IMDB.
-   seasons: Number of seasons if it's a show.
-   imdb_id: The title ID on IMDB.

## Our Challenge

In this workshop, we will explore how OpenRefine can support data organization and preparation for analysis. For instance, you might want to compare scores across genres, plot the most common age classifications over the years, or investigate whether the country of origin affects popularity. These are just a few examples of the kinds of insights you could uncover once your data is properly cleaned and organized. But before that the data has to be cleaned and prepared accordingly. Ready?
