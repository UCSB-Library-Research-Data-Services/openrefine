## Why OpenRefine?

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) is a powerful open-source multiplatform and free data cleaning and transformation tool designed to work with large datasets. It helps users explore, clean, and refine data, making it easier to analyze and prepare for further use with no coding skills required.

One of the key strengths of OpenRefine is its ability to track every action you take through its project history feature. This means you can easily review, reverse, or revisit any step in your data cleaning process. It makes the entire workflow reproducible, as you can apply the same steps to other datasets or go back to previous stages without losing any progress.

What really sets OpenRefine apart, though, is how it combines this project history with version control. This is especially useful when working in teams. As your project evolves, version control allows you to track changes over time, keeping everyone aligned and on the same page. If you’re working with multiple collaborators, you can rely on OpenRefine’s version history to ensure that everyone is using the same cleaning process and has access to the latest changes. This collaborative feature is a big advantage over other tools, which often don’t offer such detailed tracking or easy collaboration, making it harder to maintain consistency or manage multiple revisions.

Additionally, since OpenRefine is open-source, you can create and share custom extensions, further streamlining teamwork. The combination of project history and version control makes OpenRefine particularly powerful for teams, ensuring a smooth, consistent, and transparent workflow, all while reducing the risk of errors. Unlike other data cleaning tools, OpenRefine offers a level of collaboration and organization that helps keep your cleaning process standardized and your team on track.

## Donwload & Requirements

OpenRefine is designed to work with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems and can be downloaded from <https://openrefine.org/download>. To run OpenRefine, Java must be installed. The Mac version includes Java, and OpenRefine 3.4 or higher offers a Windows package with Java included. Alternatively, you can install Java (JRE) from [Adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net). On Windows, if Java isn’t installed, OpenRefine will automatically open a browser window with installation instructions.

## macOS Verification

When you first try to launch OpenRefine on a Mac by double-clicking its icon, you might see a message saying:

> *"OpenRefine cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."*

If this appears, click Cancel to dismiss the message.

To open the application anyway:

1.  Right-click (or Control-click) the OpenRefine icon.

2.  Choose Open from the context menu.

3.  A similar warning will appear, but this time it will include an Open button.

4.  Click Open to launch the application.

macOS will remember this choice, and you won’t need to repeat these steps the next time you open OpenRefine.
:::

If you're using the desktop version, double-click on the OpenRefine icon or run the executable. OpenRefine runs in the browser but it does not require internet access for basic functions. It works best on browsers using the engine [WebKit](https://webkit.org), such as Chrome and Safari. No matter how you start OpenRefine, it will load its interface in your computer’s default browser.
