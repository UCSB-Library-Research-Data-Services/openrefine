Our team offers support across the research data lifecycle, from pre-project planning to post-project archival, connecting researchers with both locally- and externally-provided resources, data management systems and curation services. Our goal is to ensure that all research data is well-described, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), as well as sustainable and preservable, and that researchers receive scholarly credit for sharing and publishing their data.

We recommend you explore the Research Computing and Data website (<https://rcd.ucsb.edu> ) maintained by our department for campus-wide tools, recommendations, events, communities and learning resources.
